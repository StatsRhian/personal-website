Quarto allows you to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output and tell a story. When the underlying data inevitably changes, a click of a button will update the document like magic – automatically updating plots, tables and text. This style of automated reporting makes data analysis more efficient and reproducible. Quarto supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, slides, dashboards, scientific articles and more.\nBy the end of the workshop you will be able to:\n\nuse Markdown formatting to customise a document\nembed R code into a Quarto report\ndynamically embed plots and tables\n\nThe resources for this workshop are available on GitHub.\nJoint work with Nicola Rennie\nCover Image: Duke Lemur Center."

    "title": "An introvert’s guide to networking at a conference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Uh oh. Conferences. I’ve been trying not to think about them, but I can’t put it off any longer.\nThat’s okay! It might not be too late to book on to the conferences you want to attend. Some will even still have early bird offers available if you’re quick.\n\n\nOh that’s not a problem. I’m already booked on, travel is arranged, my talk is written. It’s just …\n… just what?\n\n\n… there’s so many people and events. My manager said “they’re great networking opportunities” so I think she’s expecting me to come back with a whole list of new contacts too.\nOh! Well I love attending conferences. Spending time with interesting people, and meeting new folk leaves me all energised and buzzy. But conferences aren’t just for extroverts like me.\nSetting your manager’s possible expectations aside for a second, just focus on what you can benefit from when networking: Meeting the people behind interesting projects that could be helpful to you; encountering contacts with interesting job opportunities; finding like-minded people to attend the social events with.\nMaybe I can help you out with a few tips?\n\n\nThat would be great! How should I prepare?\nBefore you get there, you can use social media. Conferences often have #hashtags associated with them. If you use social media, posting about the event can be a great, low-stress way to engage with other attendees.\nI often post something like\n“Excited to be on my way to Seattle for #positconf2024 ️🛬 Anyone else there this year?”\nwhen I’m travelling.\nThat way, if someone I already know is attending, we can make plans to meet up and hang out together.\n\n\nThat’s a nice idea. But what happens if I don’t already know people who are going?\nCheck the event schedule for the conference. There is often a welcome event aimed at people who are new to the conference.\nThe day before the RSS International Conference, the Young Statisticians arrange a workshop to help early career statisticians get to know the organisers and make some conference friends before the main event starts.\n\n\nSounds useful. But I’m going to encounter people at some point and I never know what to say.\nFirst of all, people love talking about themselves, and they like you for taking an interest and listening to them. Think up and remember a few standard questions that can get the ball rolling and see where the conversation goes from there.\n\nWhere do you work?\nWhat parts of the work do you enjoy?\nDid you travel far to get here?\nDid you go to University?\nWhere did you study?\nWhat’s the funniest issue you’ve encountered in your work?\n\n\n\nOh so I just to need to remember some questions to ask?\nYes, and come up with some nice icebreakers if you can.\n\n\nOr nicebreakers. See what I did there?\nYou must be very pleased with yourself.\n\n\nI am actually.\nWell don’t forget the time will come where you have to introduce yourself in return. A little preparation goes a long way here.\nPrepare a short sentence explaining who you are, what you do and what you’re interested in. At networking events, you’ll constantly be asked these questions. Preparing a two-minute introduction and practicing it slowly out loud can help you feel more confident in the moment.\nAnd it might sound silly, but make a conscious effort to say your name and company slowly when you first introduce yourself. I find myself saying “Hi, I’m Rhian and I work for Jumping Rivers” so many times, that I naturally rush over the words, creating an awkward situation where the other person didn’t catch your name.\n\n\nSo I should rehearse by talking to myself the mirror like they do on The Sims?\nIf that helps you, sure. It doesn’t have to be perfectly scripted, but making a coherent introduction of yourself creates a good first impression.\n\n\nWhen I’m there, won’t everyone already know each other already?\nRemember, plenty of people go to conferences alone and don’t know anyone else attending. If there’s a pub quiz, or other team-based social activity, it’s okay to turn up by yourself. It’s the organisers’ job to make you feel welcome and help you find others to chat with.\nThere’s also going to be events such as poster sessions and welcome drinks, where it’s entirely normal for anyone to be interacting with new people. The individuals you do meet may go on to introduce you to other people they know at the conference.\n\n\nOh yeah, this schedule has a few of those sessions with free snacks and drinks.\nTake it easy on the free wine and coffee. It’s easy to use alcohol and copious amounts of coffee to boost your networking bravery at the poster session. However, too much caffeine or alcohol can cause social anxiety and leave you feeling queasy the next morning.\n\n\nAre you speaking from personal experience here?\nMaybe 😳\n\n\nWhat if I don’t drink alcohol?\nThere’s also no obligation to drink alcohol. Younger generations are increasingly becoming non-drinkers, and most events will have a decent selection of non-alcoholic drinks. Some conferences organise alcohol-free socials too, like an evening walking-tour or a morning run group.\n\n\nThese networking events sound busy.\nYes, some of these events can be crowded and noisy. For some people, that can be a bit overwhelming. It’s perfectly okay to step outside for fresh air or to sit in a quieter corner to regain some energy. In fact, it can be a good idea because it’s unlikely that you’ll be the only person to do this—other like minded introverts will also have the same idea, giving you an opportunity to meet someone new in a quieter location.\n\n\nIf there’s alcohol at a session, like a pub quiz or a poster session, should I be talking about business or avoiding work-related topics?\nThis is a tricky one. Some people will be aiming to create business connections and opportunities, and some will be in a more relaxed and sociable mode. This is a situation where you have to read the intentions of the other person and adapt.\nIt’s totally okay to talk about non-work topics at any point during the conference. Chatting about hobbies and finding common interests is a great way to connect with people. If someone wants to talk to you about a business opportunity, they will likely steer the conversation back to work, and move on if they don’t think you can help them. Don’t take this personally! People have different reasons for attending conferences.\nIt can also depend on the conference. Some massive machine learning and AI expos can be very business focused, whilst smaller academic or programming conferences can have more of a community feel. If you aren’t sure about the vibe, you can always ask someone who has attended that conference before.\n\n\nHow do I maintain contact with the people I meet?\nTraditionally, you would exchange business cards. In Japan there’s even an etiquette for receiving a business card where you take a moment to admire and study the person’s details on the card you’ve just received—they’d never take a business card and rush it straight into their wallet alongside countless other business cards to be forgotten.\nBut in this modern world, business cards are becoming less common. So if you don’t have cards to hand out, try connecting with them over LinkedIn—the LinkedIn app allows you to share a QR code to link straight to your profile. Or if either of you don’t use LinkedIn, you can exchange email addresses. If the other person agrees, consider taking a selfie with them and emailing it to their address straight away—not only have you exchanged details, but provided a visual memento and opened a conversation channel for further discussions after the conference.\n\n\nI’m not used to a conference this big. There’s multiple talks going on at the same time. What’s the etiquette if I want to be in different sessions for different talks?\nLook at the conference programme in advance to plan which talks you want to attend. Big conferences often have “streams” meaning multiple talks will be happening concurrently.\nThe start and end times of the talks are often scheduled to match across sessions, so you can switch between streams during the sessions between each talk. It’s quite common to see a few people leave at the end of a talk to jump to the other stream. If you want to change session, go at the same time as this crowd—just move briskly and quietly so you cause minimal disruption, and sit strategically close to the exit for a quick escape.\nBut sometimes it can be a bit awkward to sneak out of the back mid-session, especially if the room is small or talks are overrunning, so sometimes it’s easier just to commit yourself to a single stream per session.\n\n\nOkay, gotcha. Plan the sessions to attend in advance. While I’m doing that, are there any useful sessions I should consider?\nSome conferences have specific networking sessions for people that already have things in common like the “Birds of a Feather” sessions at Posit Conference. These are short, one-off meetups for people who have something in common, e.g. R educators, people working with R in insurance, R-Ladies or R users from Africa. These groups are often smaller and you already have something in common, making networking a little less daunting and the connections a little more relevant.\n\n\nRight, I’ve been through the whole schedule. I think I’ve picked something for each session now, and wow, I’m going to be busy!\nGreat! Just remember that you don’t have to go to every session and social event. It’s totally okay to skip a session and recharge. Conferences can be exhausting, even I need a quiet minute to myself sometimes. Grab yourself a cup of tea and find a quiet corner to have a little break from the stimulus. Or head back to your hotel room for an afternoon nap. Then you’ll be refreshed for the next session. (Just remember to set an alarm… ⏰)\n\n\nWell thank you for the advice. I’m not sure I can think of any more questions.\nWell on the topic of questions, I have one last tip. If you enjoyed someone’s talk, but don’t want to ask a question in the session, you can go and talk to them in the coffee break following their talk. From the speaker’s perspective, it’s nice to chat with people who got value from your talk, and you’ll have another friendly face in the lunch queue.\n\n\nDo you have any suggestions for good conferences to go to?\nHow about SatRdays London in April or Shiny in Production in October? You can register to attend by visiting those websites. They’re being organised by Jumping Rivers.\n\n\nI’ll take a look, thanks.\nAnd hey, if I see you there, you’ll have an extroverted friend who can introduce to you everyone at the conference.\n\n\noh no 😰\n_This post first appeared at jumpingrivers.com/blog and was co-written with Keith Newman."

    "title": "Refactoring Russian Doll Code",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, I’ve been working with an environmental scientist to refactor a large R package. Let’s call her Jane.\nJane inherited a mess of code, and had to get it working as quickly as possible. She tidied up it as best as she could in the time, but now that the company depended on it, it needed some attention. We referred to it as her “Russian Doll code” because it had many nested functions, each passing the same giant nested lists back and forth. I could see that it frustrated her every time she had to touch it as she knew there was a better way to structure the code.\nWe booked in some 1:1 support sessions and sat down together with the aim of making the code easier to work with.\n\n\nDefine the messy zone\nYou know when you tidy your bedroom, you optimistically pull everything out onto the floor. A few hours later, the bed is covered and there are piles of clothes everywhere. There’s no going back, and you aren’t going to be able to sleep on your bed tonight unless you clean everything. (Just me?)\nThroughout the refactoring process, it was essential that we were able to continuously run and test the functionality of the package. But how could we rewrite all of our functions without affecting the functionality of the whole code base?\nWe decided to start with the smallest functions, and re-write the main body of the code. However, in order to ensure the higher-level functions still worked, we defined a messy zone at the start and end of each function. In the top messy zone, we would reassign any function parameters to have better names and structure. In the bottom messy zone, we would ensure that the function return matched the old return. We were then free to completely refactor the main bit of the function, knowing that the inputs and outputs were handled.\nBeing explicit about where the mess is “allowed” let us to focus on simplifying and clarifying the internals whilst still ensuring that the higher level code functioned as expected. It also meant that we didn’t have to decide on the structure of the function parameters initially, and we could work that out naturally as the code evolved. It also gave us clear markers of where we would need to clean up later, and avoided the issue of forgetting to change parameters everywhere.\nexample = function(arg1, arg2) {\n    # Messy zone\n    \n    a_better_name = arg1$mess$ugh\n    helpful_name = arg2$what$is$this\n    \n    # Refactor the internals\n    \n    useful_result = a_better_name + helpful_name\n    sensible_name_tibble = a_better_name * helpful_name    \n    \n    # Messy Zone\n    results$some$mess = useful_result\n    results$another$naff$list = sensible_name_tibble\n    \n}\n\n\nPush the mess up (Push it real good)\nOnce we refactored the main bodies of all the small, inner functions, it was time to clean up the mess we had made earlier. We started by listing the arguments and returns of the inner functions. Once we had decided on sensible names and formats, we changed them all in one go across all functions - clearing the messy zone.\nWe were then free to move up a level, to the next Russian doll, pushing the mess up. We kept repeating this process, slowly moving up through the layers, from the smallest Russian doll, up until we were at the top of the code base.\n\n\n\nStart with a blank slate\nWhen you’re refactoring a function, it can be tempting to copy the old function into a new script, and just start editing. However, the copy-paste method for refactoring can tie you to the style of the old function, making redesign harder. We found that writing the revised functions from scratch forced us to reconsider every step of the old function and challenge every step. Ask yourself, what is this function actually trying to achieve, and how should we implement it?\n\n\nTake time to design\nJane and I had one session where we didn’t touch any code at all. We talked, doodled and drew diagrams. You might leave a session like this feeling a little deflated that you didn’t achieve anything. However, that session was actually the most valuable. In the following session we made huge progress, because we had already done the hard work of thinking out the design fully. We were able to whizz through the functions, implementing our new design efficiently. We found ourselves constantly referring back to the diagrams to remind ourselves of the design choices we had made.\n\n\nA good name goes a long way\nWe all know that it’s important to choose good names for parameters and functions. However, in this project, I was surprised just how much of a difference a good name makes. Sometimes, the only thing we would change in a function would be the names. Often a simple rename morphed the unintelligible code in front of me into a clear, readable explanation of the approach.\n\n\nTest regularly\nThings are going to go wrong. You are going to accidentally delete a line of code, or put a bracket in the wrong place. If you ensure that your code is always run-able then you can constantly check your code still works by running your tests. This is particularly important when implementing statistical models to ensure that numerical results are unaffected by the refactor. In R, the {testthat} package makes it easy and painless to add package tests. If you’re using git, using continuous integration to run an R package check on every commit takes away the burden of remembering to stop and test.\n\n\nWhy rather than How\nThe code was initially what I would call “How” programming. The different components of the functions were grouped by how the calculations were computed programmatically rather than why we were calculating them. This made it hard for someone new to the code to understand what each function did.\nI’m not an environmental scientist, so I don’t understand all of the science behind Jane’s complex model. However, by asking questions about what she was trying to achieve, we re-grouped the different stages of each function in terms of the science, rather than the implementation. Changing focus of the code to the scientific method made it much clearer to follow.\n\n\n\nDo it with a friend\nRefactoring can be quite daunting. You’ve often got lots of moving parts and it can be difficult to hold both the overall design, and the small technical details in your head at the same time. Having someone to pair program with you makes this much easier. In our sessions, Jane would “drive”, coding the finer technical implementations, whilst I was the passenger, observing and challenging her on whether the implementation she was writing fitted in with our grand design. The person helping you doesn’t have to understand the code in detail, in fact sometimes it helps if they don’t! It can also be more fun to work collaboratively, we would celebrate together when we were able to delete a large chunk of obsolete code.\n\n\nWrap up\nRefactoring code properly takes time, and sometimes it can be hard to justify the cost. However, poorly written code is difficult to develop, time consuming to maintain and tends to mask bugs which are hiding in the cobwebs of functions that no-one really understands any more. Hopefully these tips will help the next time you get the chance to refactor some code. Here they are again:\n\nDefine the messy zone\nPush the mess up\nStart with a blank slate\nTake time to design\nA good name goes a long way\nTest regularly\nWhy rather than How\nDo it with a friend\n\nThis post first appeared at jumpingrivers.com/blog"

    "title": "Did rough sleeping increase after the 2010 election?",
    "section": "What’s the problem?",
    "text": "What’s the problem?\nRough sleeping statistics are official statistics, published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. In 2010, the way that rough sleeping statistics were reported changed. The differences are described in this technical note.\nThere are a number of points highlighted in the technical guidance, but the two key ones for me are:\n\nthe definition of a rough sleeper was changed to include rough sleepers about to bed down (e.g. sitting or standing near their bedding but not actually lying down) and those in tents. Broadening the definition of what counts as “rough sleeping” will likely increase the counts.\nPrior to 2010, Local Authorities with more than ten rough sleepers had to perform and report a count of rough sleepers in their area. Local Authorities are now able to choose whether to report a count or an estimate. Estimates are made by consulting with local agencies and the community to compile and agree a figure. The technical guide provides a comparison of the statistics before and after the change (Table 1), the largest increase was seen in the local authorities that switched from a count to an estimate.\n\nThe report then states\n\nThe changes that have been made to the methodology and the definition of rough sleepers make it very difficult to make comparisons over time as we cannot separate the impact of these methodological changes from changes in the level of rough sleeping between autumn 2010 and earlier time periods. It is therefore not possible to determine accurately whether rough sleeping has increased as we cannot separate the differences resulting from methodological changes from changes in the level of rough sleeping between time periods."

    "text": "So what?\nWhen making statistical comparisons, it’s important to compare like with like. We can still say that rough sleeping figures did decrease from 1998 to 2010, during Labour’s time in power. However, it is not possible to determine accurately whether rough sleeping has increased after 2010, as we cannot separate the methodological differences from the changes in the number of people sleeping rough.\nThe two time series are not directly comparable, and this should be highlighted in the graphic if presenting the two series as one."

    "title": "The effect of recovery algorithms on compressive sensing background subtraction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background subtraction is a key method required to aid processing surveillance videos. Current methods require storing each pixel of every video frame, which can be wasteful as most of this information refers to the uninteresting background. Compressive sensing can offer an efficient solution by using the fact that foreground is often sparse in the spatial domain. By making this assumption and applying a specific recovery algorithm to a trained background, it is possible to reconstruct the foreground, using only a low dimensional representation of the difference between the current frame and the estimated background scene. Although new compressive sensing background subtraction algorithms are being created, no study has been made of the effect of recovery algorithms on performance of background subtraction. This is considered by applying both Basis Pursuit and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to a standard test video, and comparing their accuracy."
