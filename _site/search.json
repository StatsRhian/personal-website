If they are not R users, they may not be able to use your work without translating it into their language of choice. However, if your model is available in the form of an API, then anybody can import your results without this difficult translation step.\nMaking your models available through an API reduces the handoff between R and other tools or technologies.

Current methods require storing each pixel of every video frame, which can be wasteful as most of this information refers to the uninteresting background. Compressive sensing can offer an efficient solution by using the fact that foreground is often sparse in the spatial domain. By making this assumption and applying a specific recovery algorithm to a trained background, it is possible to reconstruct the foreground, using only a low dimensional representation of the difference between the current frame and the estimated background scene. Although new compressive sensing background subtraction algorithms are being created, no study has been made of the effect of recovery algorithms on performance of background subtraction.

    "text": "Abstract\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto allows you to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output and tell a story. When the underlying data inevitably changes, a click of a button will update the document like magic – automatically updating plots, tables and text. This style of automated reporting makes data analysis more efficient and reproducible. Quarto supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, slides, dashboards, scientific articles and more.\nBy the end of the workshop you will be able to:\n\nuse Markdown formatting to customise a document\nembed R code into a Quarto report\ndynamically embed plots and tables\n\nThe resources for this workshop are available on GitHub.\nJoint work with Nicola Rennie\nCover Image: Duke Lemur Center."
