  I am a data scientist at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/). I'm an active communicator and a [statistical ambassador](http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/Influencing_Change/Statistical_literacy/RSS_statistical_ambassadors/RSS/Influencing_Change/Statistical_literacy_sub/RSS_statistical_ambassadors.aspx?hkey=d06d38f3-8148-4fde-891a-5e3e7fe4fffc) for the Royal Statistical Society. I'm an R geek and co-organise the Lancaster chapter of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/about-us/). When I'm not at a laptop, you'll find me outdoors. I love cycling, sea kayaking, fell running and climbing.
