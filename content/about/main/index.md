  I am a data scientist at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/). I'm an active communicator and a [statistical ambassador](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2018/general-news/speaking-for-statistics-the-rss-statistical-ambass/) for the Royal Statistical Society. I'm an #RStats geek and co-organise the Lancaster chapter of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/about-us/). When I'm not at a laptop, you'll find me outdoors. I love cycling, sea kayaking, fell running and climbing.
