<p>When people ask me “How do I learn R”, I always point them towards the excellent <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science book.</a> It’s freely available and I love the order the chapters, starting with visualisation and tidy data before delving into the details of programming with R.</p>
<p>Recently a <a href="http://www.rfordatasci.com/">community</a> has developed around this book, when I act as a mentor. One of the regular community events is <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday</a>, a weekly challenge to take a dataset and create a visualisation`.</p>
<p>I had a go at the week 4 submission on Global Mortality data.</p>
<p>I decided to attempt to make some <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparklines</a> graphics. I used code from <a href="https://twitter.com/lukaszpiwek">Dr Lukasz Piwek</a> and his <a href="http://www.motioninsocial.com/tufte/#sparklines">Tufte in R</a> project. It’s a great project and I hope I get chance to play with some of the other plots in the future.</p>
<p>I started off considering death by Cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>I wrote some code which identified the 5 countries with the largest increase in share of death by cardiovascular diseases, and also the 5 countries with the largest decrease. These 10 countries were then plotted as a sparkline, with the minimum and maximum values highlighted.</p>
<p>I then wrapped this code as a function, and generated plots for all possible causes of death to look for interesting findings. Full code is available on <a href="https://github.com/trianglegirl/r4ds/tree/master/2018-04-17-global-mortality">Github.</a></p>

<p>As a quick plot, I’m fairly happy with this. However, as always there are many ways to improve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Looping over all possible causes of death generates some weird plots, especially when the percentages are small.</li>
<li>The Sparkline plots should probably be more information rich and have less white space to make Tufte happy.</li>
<li>My function to create the sparkline plots should probably be chunked into smaller functions</li>
</ul>
