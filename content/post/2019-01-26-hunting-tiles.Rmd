One of the best features of Veloviewer is the [explorer score](https://blog.veloviewer.com/veloviewer-explorer-score-and-max-square/). Essentially, the map is split into a grid of tiles, and if any of your activities cross into a tile then it gets a tick. Since starting recording rides and runs in 2013, I have ticked off a total of 2141 tiles. In 2018, I covered 762 tiles, and 418 of these were "new" tiles. This image below shows the the tiles which I have covered so far.

The new tiles in 2018 were mostly gathered during our big trips away such as cycling to the [Isle of Man](https://www.strava.com/activities/1699907898) and our holidays to [Malta](https://www.strava.com/activities/1386493191) and the [Trossachs in Scotland](https://www.strava.com/activities/1849609726).

We also did a couple of longer bike rides such and [Howgill Lane](https://www.strava.com/activities/1555798288), [Kirby Stephen](https://www.strava.com/activities/1687019306) and the [Fylde Coast](https://www.strava.com/activities/1800611999).

In 2019 I'd like to cover more than 418 new tiles. We have a couple of big trips lined up, including cycling to North West Wales, and a week exploring Devon.

I'd also like to expand my max cluster. This is represented by the blue tiles, and in 2018 I had a max cluster of 164. In order to expand it, I aim to link up Kirby Lonsdale, Settle and Grasmere. 

Finally, the black squares in the image relate to the maximum square you have covered. So far I have a max quare of 7x7. Increasing this is quite difficult due to being near the sea, however, I think I can increase this to 8x8.
