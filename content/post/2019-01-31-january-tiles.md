January was suprisingly a good start for tiles. We got a [sunny ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/2048516081) in on January 1st along Marshaw. Another weekend we drove out to Longridge and did a [loop from Longridge](https://www.strava.com/activities/2073521865), taking in the house which James grew up in. 

I went to Tavira to visit my family and managed to get a couple of tiles from beach walks and a [coastal run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2086542194).

Undoubtedly the main focus for January for me was That's Lyth. We managed to do two recees before the actual day, and I was chuffed to get around in just under 6 hours.

In terms of the tiles, my max cluster increased mostly due to connecting up new tiles west of Kendal.

## Summary
* New tiles this year: 99
* New tiles all time: 50
* Max cluster: 178
