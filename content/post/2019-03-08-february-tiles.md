February was not quite as lucrative for tiles. 

I did one [tile hunting ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/2121232456) early in February, which gained me three new all time tiles and increased my max cluster. We also did a really [lovely run in the Howgills](https://www.strava.com/activities/2136870430), however, I ran on paths I had run before meaning - no new tiles.

February has been quite a crazy month for us, with moving house and interviewing for a new job. Hopefully March will include more adventures afar and new tiles!

## Summary
* New tiles this year: 122
* New tiles all time: 53
* Max cluster: 185
