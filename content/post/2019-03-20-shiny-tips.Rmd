Things I learnt from the advanced Shiny Mango course.

## Showcase

Use "showcase" to see the shiny code along side the app
```{r showcase, eval = FALSE}
runApp(app.R, displaymode = "showcase")
```


objects("package:shiny", pattern = "render")
Draw a reactive network diagrams
# The difference between Reactive() vs Observe()
Isolate()
switch()
I()

## Use eventReactive for a better UX

isTruthy()
req()
validate()
