We managed a little more adventuring in March.

James signed up to run the Heptonstall fell race, near Hebden Bridge. We decided to make a weekend of it stay over for a night at Widdop Reservoir. This meant that although I wasn't racing, I managed a couple of [nice walks](https://www.strava.com/activities/2238190550) in a new area.

On the last weeked of March, I did a short, tile bagging ride around Catterall. I managed to get about 9 new tiles, and this increased my max cluster, linking up Beacon Fell.


## Summary
* New tiles this year: 153
* New tiles all time: 71
* Max cluster: 204
