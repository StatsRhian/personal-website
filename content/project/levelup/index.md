I keep detailed CPD records for my professional development. I store each activity as a YAML file, allowing me to pull in data and write [annual reports](https://statsrhian.github.io/professional-development/cpd-report/cpd-report.html) in R Markdown. 
The {levelup} R package contains helper functions for me to create and manage those YAML files.
