title: "What Iâ€™m doing now"

_Updated 2025-08-29. Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about)._

Iâ€™ve had a lovely summer travelling around Scotland in my campervan and spending plenty of time on the water kayaking. Now, Iâ€™m looking forward to a cosy autumn, contributing to community projects and playing [games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetrianglegirl/).

This season I want to give more energy to community work. Iâ€™ve recently joined the leadership team for [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org), and weâ€™re meeting in person to think about how to grow the community and shape our first conference. Iâ€™m also hoping to spend more time supporting the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/conference.html).

Outside of work, Iâ€™ve started a small community paddling group, Canny Paddlers, and weâ€™re organising a kayak symposium in Northumberland next May.

In work, Iâ€™d like to settle into a routine, prioritising morning beach walks and some weekly time for reflection. Iâ€™m also aiming to complete my [Advanced Data Science Professional](https://rss.org.uk/membership/professional-development/advanced-data-science-professional/) award. Iâ€™ve got a handful of conferences ahead. Iâ€™m looking forward to catching up with awesome, inspiring folk, in person. If youâ€™re at any of these, come say hi ðŸ‘‹
