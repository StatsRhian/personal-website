## What Iâ€™m doing now

_Updated 2024-01-09. Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about)._

After five years, I'm moving on from Jumping Rivers and starting a new job in March. 
I've been reflecting on my time at JR, and preparing for the transition to a new role. 
I'm trying to get more involved in the North East tech scene, and find online communities of people working with UK health data. 

I've begun converting my van into a campervan. It's a very much a slow, learning project and I'm hoping to be ready for adventures when spring comes around again. I'm enjoying learning new skills, and having the support of friends. 

I'm currently working four days a week, and I'm spending my Fridays paddling, cycling and walking the North East coastline. I'm hoping to keep regain some fitness over winter so that I'm ready to play in the summer.
