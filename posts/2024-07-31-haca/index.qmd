Last week I was at #HACA2024 - a great conference bringing together health and social care analysts around the U.K 

It was really inspiring to see lots of projects on their #RAP journey and #RStats and #Python code being shared openly ðŸ¥³ 

What I didn't hear was analysts telling stories of how they implemented else's open-source project successfully on their own data. So why not?

Are we building tools that aren't modular enough? Or user-friendly? Is re-usability not valued highly enough? Or is the difficulty getting the word out to the right people? Are we just too polite?

A conversation to continue at NHS RPySOC?
