## Abstract

This will be a beginner friendly session where we will learn how to access and transform data. Even if you've never used R before, you'll be able to take part and do some coding.

We'll be working through Chapter 5 of the R for Data Science book. This is available freely online at http://r4ds.had.co.nz . There will be a short presentation and then we'll work through some exercises together.
