## Abstract

This is a beginner friendly session. We'll be working through Chapter 16 of the R for Data Science book, which deals with manipulating dates and times. This is available freely online at http://r4ds.had.co.nz . There will be a short presentation and then we'll work through some exercises together.

Afterwards, we will try these out on our own data. So please, if you can, bring along some of your own data. You could be working on this data at the moment, or it could be something you have used in the past. If you don't have any data, this would be a good learning opportunity to try and find some open source data from the internet.
