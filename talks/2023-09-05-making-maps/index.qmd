## Abstract

Maps can be a powerful way to communicate your research to wider audiences. Traditionally, you would need to use a specific geographic information system (GIS) tool for mapping. R is now a widely used open source software platform for working with spatial data thanks to its powerful analysis and visualisation packages.

In this workshop, youâ€™ll learn the fundamentals of working with geospatial data in R. You'll create high-quality, informative maps - that look great too!

If you want to participate in the exercises, please bring a laptop to the session. There is no need to install anything in advance. Some basic prior knowledge is helpful but not essential for attending this session.
