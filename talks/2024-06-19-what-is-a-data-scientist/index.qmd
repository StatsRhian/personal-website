## Abstract

Join the IMA ECM community in hosting 5 speakers to discuss ‘What is a Data Scientist?’. This will be a 2 hour event where we hear from data scientists in different organisations about their careers and learn more about the Alliance for Data Science Professionals.

We will be joined by Yousuf Mohammed (MSci Student & Incoming Lloyds Banking Group), Rhian Davies (Senior Data Scientist, The Strategy Unit (NHS), Thom Kirwan-Evans (Co-founder, Origami Labs) and Duncan Wotherspoon (Junior Data Scientist, Investment Manager in London) in a panel session. Each panellist will give an introduction to themselves and then we’ll open the virtual floor up for a Q&A session.

## Notes
