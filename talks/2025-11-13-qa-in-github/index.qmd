## Abstract

Quality assurance is vital for trust in analytical models. Resources like the Aqua Book, the Duck Book, and NAO guidance give useful principles, but they can feel a bit abstract when you’re actually trying to apply them. I didn’t want to be stuck updating another colour-coded spreadsheet, so we took a different approach. In this talk, I’ll show how our team has made QA practical, reproducible, and part of everyday work using GitHub.
