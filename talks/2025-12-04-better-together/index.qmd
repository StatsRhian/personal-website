## Abstract

Implementing reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) can feel daunting for both analysts and managers. The Strategy Unit runs regular RAP drop-ins, open sessions where teams can ask questions, share challenges, and learn from each other in a supportive space.

Topics often include navigating IT restrictions, learning Git, and managing patient-identifiable data safely. The sessions work not because we have all the answers, but because they connect people and surface practical solutions.

In this talk, Iâ€™ll share common questions, key lessons, and tips from the drop-ins, showing how collaborative, inclusive spaces help teams adopt RAP more confidently and strengthen analytical capability across health and care systems.
