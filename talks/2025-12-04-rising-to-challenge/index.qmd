## Abstract

A live, interview-style conversation with analysts from across health and care. Hosted by James Sandy, Senior Consultant/ Interviewer (The Strategy Unit) with Rhian Davies Senior Data Scientist (Strategy Unit), Tom Smith, Head of Activity Analysis & Forecasting (Nottingham University Hospitals) and Shevon Licorish, Head of Data Visualisation (NHS Kent & Medway ICB).

We’ll explore how they found their voice, where analysis changes decisions, and what the analyst of the future looks like - connecting human stories to HACA’s theme: Rising to the challenge - analysis at the heart of health and care systems of the future.

Each guest will be invited to talk about current role, career path and challenges along the way and they welcome audience questions so line them up! We'll then look ahead: what will the analyst role look like in 10 years? and what advice helps early-career analysts now? We'll see where the conversation takes us but join us to find out more about the stories of these analysts and how they help us to 'Rise to the Challenge'
