## Abstract

Think R packages are only for coding pros? This beginner-friendly workshop will change your mind. We’ll gently unpack what an R package actually is, why you might want one (even if you think you don’t), and how packages can make your work easier to reuse, share, and maintain.

Together, we’ll build a simple R package from scratch using the {usethis} package. We’ll explore the basic structure of a package, add our own functions, write clear documentation, and check that everything works as expected. Along the way, we’ll also look at practical ways to share your package with others.

By the end of the session, you’ll have a working R package, a clearer mental model of how packages work, and the confidence to keep building.

To take part in the interactive parts of the workshop, you’ll need to install a few packages in advance.
